# Scripts
## Using this repository(on a UNIX-like system)
1. Clone this repository into any folder(usually the Downloads folder in user's home folder) with `git clone https://github.com/trivalsion/unix/`
2. Run the `./scripts/main.sh` script and answer all of it's prompts, this script will configure a UNIX-like system
3. Check if everything `main.sh` prints out in "Done" section of it's output, was done by it
4. Read and do other recommendations printed out by the `main.sh` script after it has finished(e.g. run needed scripts in ./scripts/configurators)


## Repository Layout
* `configuration` folder - contains guides describing manual configuration of different parts of the system that were not configured by the script
* `scripts` folder - contains scripts that configure the system
  * `main.sh` file - the main shell script of this repo which is able to configures different unix systems(e.g. Linux, MacOS)
  * `configurators` folder - folder containing scripts to configure applications and the system beyond what `main.sh` had configured


## Script coding rules
* All scripts should have a comment at the start of them telling about the purpose of the script, if the script has "!# /bin bash" then the comment should be directly below it, otherwise it should be on the first line of the script and should look like this:
	 * ```
	 	## Bash script which ...
		(Miss 1 line)
		(Miss 1 more line)
	 	<The script code itself>........
	    ```


## Shell Script Checking Algorithm
1. Check all the changed files .sh with [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and fix errors that show up
	* ShellCheck [developer's website](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
2. Make sure that all global varibales used by included scripts are present
3. Run the "scripts/main.sh" and any other script that was changed on a Linux VM and check if it does everything it is supposed to and that it does it correctly
